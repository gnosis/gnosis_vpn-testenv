# Gnosis VPN test environment

Local development and system-test stack for Gnosis VPN. Orchestrates a HOPR
localcluster, one or more containerised Gnosis VPN server (exit node) instances,
and a containerised Gnosis VPN client against them.

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with flakes enabled
- [just](https://just.systems/) (system-level; must be available outside any Nix
  shell to avoid nesting issues)
- Docker (or Podman / Apple `container`)
- Sibling repos checked out at the paths below (overridable)

## Why the client runs in its own container

The client and the exit-node servers used to run on the same host network. The
client's full-tunnel WireGuard route (`0.0.0.0/1` + `128.0.0.0/1` via `wg0`) is
installed into the _main routing table_, so once it was up, it captured every
outbound packet on that host — including the exit-node container's own
Docker-NATed egress to the real internet. That packet would get pulled back into
the tunnel instead of leaving, producing a routing loop rather than internet
access.

Running the client in its own container fixes this architecturally: its
full-tunnel route now lives only in the client container's own network
namespace, so it can no longer capture the exit-node container's (or the host's)
traffic. The localcluster still runs natively on the host; the client container
reaches it over a dedicated Docker network (see below).

## Sibling repo paths

By default the recipes expect these repos next to each other:

```
parent/
  gnosis_vpn-testenv/   ← this repo
  hoprd/
  gnosis_vpn-server/
  gnosis_vpn-client/
```

Override any path via environment variable — useful in CI where repos are
checked out independently:

```sh
HOPRD_DIR=/ci/hoprd \
GVPN_SERVER_DIR=/ci/gnosis_vpn-server \
GVPN_CLIENT_DIR=/ci/gnosis_vpn-client \
  just up
```

## Development setup

```sh
# 1. Build all components and start the full stack, including the client container
just development-setup

# 2. Tail the client container's logs
docker logs -f gnosis_vpn-client

# 3. Tear everything down (stops client, servers, cluster, and metrics)
just down
```

`just development-setup` builds all components, then brings the whole stack up
(localcluster, VPN server(s), metrics, generated config, and the client
container); the client container gets its WireGuard/routing privileges from
`--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` instead of host root, so no `sudo` is needed for that.

`just up` (and thus `development-setup`) finishes by printing a summary: the
`gnosis_vpn-ctl` commands to control the client and each component's checked-out
commit (and tag, if any) for `gnosis_vpn-client`/`gnosis_vpn-server`/`hoprd`.
Re-print it anytime with `just summary`.

`just up` does the same without the build step; useful for scripting and CI when
components are pre-built.

## Issuing client commands

Once the stack is up, control the running client via `gnosis_vpn-ctl` inside its
container — the client image symlinks the binary onto `PATH` for exactly this
purpose:

```sh
docker exec -it gnosis_vpn-client gnosis_vpn-ctl status
docker exec -it gnosis_vpn-client gnosis_vpn-ctl connect <destination-id>
docker exec -it gnosis_vpn-client gnosis_vpn-ctl --help
```

`gnosis_vpn-ctl` talks to the client's `gnosis_vpn-root` process over
`/var/run/gnosisvpn.sock` inside the container, so no `--socket-path` flag is
needed when run this way.

## Running system tests

```sh
just up             # build + cluster + servers + metrics + gen-config
just system-tests   # delegates to gnosis_vpn-client's system-tests with generated artifacts
just down
```

## Client state directory

The client container stores persistent state (identity keys, cache) under
`CLIENT_STATE_DIR`, bind-mounted into the container at `/var/lib/gnosisvpn`. The
container's entrypoint `chown`s it to the worker's internal user on startup, so
removing it later needs `sudo` (see below).

### Purging state

```sh
just purge-state
```

Deletes `CLIENT_STATE_DIR` after asking for a `yes` confirmation. Use this to
start with a clean identity after a failed run or when rotating keys.

## Running the client on the host (dev/debug)

```sh
just up-client-on-host
just client-logs-on-host
just client-stop-on-host
```

An alternative to `just up`/`client-start` that runs `gnosis_vpn-root` and
`gnosis_vpn-worker` as native host processes instead of in Docker — useful for
attaching a debugger or otherwise skipping the container network path. It also
runs the localcluster via `cluster-start-on-host` instead of `cluster-start`,
which binds P2P on `127.0.0.1` rather than `DOCKER_NETWORK_GATEWAY` — since
there's no containerized client to route it to over a bridge, `DOCKER_NETWORK`
isn't created or used at all in this mode, which also sidesteps the host
firewall / P2P reachability issue noted below entirely. This reintroduces the
routing-loop risk the container was built to avoid (see "Why the client runs in
its own container" above) if `gnosis_vpn-server` shares the host's egress, and
requires `CLIENT_WORKER_USER` to already exist as a system account
(`gnosis_vpn-root` drops privileges to it by uid/gid when spawning the worker —
its home directory doesn't matter). Don't run this alongside
`client-start`/`cluster-start` at the same time; they'd fight over
`CLIENT_STATE_DIR` and the default control socket. (Switching _between_
`cluster-start`/`cluster-start-on-host`/`cluster-start-on-network` sequentially
is fine — each detects the running cluster's actual `--p2p-host` via `status`
and transparently restarts it if it doesn't match what that recipe needs.)

## Running on the network (client on another machine)

```sh
just up-on-network
```

Brings up the localcluster and exit server(s) so they're reachable from another
physical machine on the LAN, instead of only from this host or its Docker
network — useful for testing against a real remote client without a container.

Unlike `up`/`up-client-on-host`, this recipe starts no client at all: the client
runs on the other machine, from its own `gnosis_vpn-client` checkout. It differs
from `cluster-start`/`cluster-start-on-host` only in what IP the localcluster
binds and announces its P2P host as — `hoprd-localcluster --p2p-host` uses the
same value for both, so it must be a real, reachable IP (see the note on
`DOCKER_NETWORK_GATEWAY` below); here that's the host's LAN-facing IP instead of
the Docker gateway or loopback. `LAN_IP` is auto-detected from the default route
(override it on multi-NIC hosts, or if detection picks the wrong interface).

`gen-config-on-network` bundles the files the other machine needs
(`client-on-network.toml`, `extra_id.id`, `extra_id.password`) into
`CONFIG_DIR/on-network/`. `up-on-network` finishes by printing:

- An `rsync` command to run _from the other machine_ that pulls
  `CONFIG_DIR/on-network/` from this host over SSH into
  `/tmp/gnosis_vpn-on-network`, plus a `chmod` to make it world-readable —
  `gnosis_vpn-worker` reads the identity file as an unprivileged user, so the
  bundle can't sit under a private home directory.
- Steps to build the client with `cargo build --release` and copy the resulting
  `gnosis_vpn-worker` binary into the worker user's home dir, `chown`ed to that
  user — the worker binary has the same unprivileged-user-can't-reach-it problem
  as the identity file above, since `target/release` sits under your home dir (a
  nix build wouldn't need this, its result lives in the world-readable
  `/nix/store`).
- The manual `gnosis_vpn-root` invocation to run there
  (`./target/release/gnosis_vpn-root --worker-binary
  ${worker_home}/gnosis_vpn-worker --state-home ${worker_home}`),
  with the identity/config/Blokli-URL/worker-user settings passed as CLI flags,
  pointing at the pulled bundle.
- The ports this host's firewall needs to allow inbound from the other machine —
  the same NixOS-firewall caveat as below applies, just against the LAN
  interface instead of the Docker bridge.

## Metrics stack

`just up` (and `just development-setup`) also starts a local metrics pipeline:

- **otelcol** — receives OTLP/HTTP on `127.0.0.1:4318` and forwards to
  VictoriaMetrics
- **VictoriaMetrics** — stores metrics and exposes a PromQL UI at
  `http://localhost:8428`

The client and server emit OpenTelemetry metrics to `127.0.0.1:4318`
automatically when the stack is up. Data is persisted under `METRICS_DATA_DIR`
between runs; `just down` stops both services but does not delete the data.

```sh
# Start/stop independently if needed
just metrics-start
just metrics-stop
```

## Port assignments

The client container publishes no ports — it only needs egress (to the
localcluster via `DOCKER_NETWORK_GATEWAY`, and to the exit node's WireGuard
tunnel via the HOPR mixnet, both outbound).

| Service                | Protocol | Host port   |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| HOPR node i            | TCP      | `3000 + i`  |
| HOPR P2P node i        | UDP      | `9000 + i`  |
| Blokli chain           | TCP      | `8080`      |
| VPN server i API       | TCP      | `8000 + i`  |
| VPN server i WireGuard | UDP      | `51821 + i` |
| otelcol OTLP/HTTP      | TCP      | `4318`      |
| VictoriaMetrics PromQL | TCP      | `8428`      |

| `clean`                    | Removes all generated configs, data dirs, log files, and Nix results           |

| `logs`                     | `tail -f` cluster node logs and `docker logs -f` the client container          |
| `node-logs`                | `tail -f` only the hoprd node logs                                             |
| `summary`                  | Print `gnosis_vpn-ctl` usage and component commits/tags (runs as part of `up`) |
| `network-create`           | Creates `DOCKER_NETWORK` (idempotent; also runs as part of `cluster-start`)    |
| `network-remove`           | Removes `DOCKER_NETWORK` (runs as part of `clean`)                             |
| `up-client-on-host`        | `up`, but the client runs natively on the host — see below                     |
| `cluster-start-on-host`    | Localcluster variant used by `up-client-on-host` — P2P on `127.0.0.1`          |
| `client-logs-on-host`      | `tail -f` the host-native client's log file                                    |
| `client-stop-on-host`      | Stops the host-native client                                                   |
| `up-on-network`            | Cluster + exit server reachable from another machine on the LAN — see below    |
| `cluster-start-on-network` | Localcluster variant used by `up-on-network` — P2P on the LAN IP               |
| `gen-config-on-network`    | Config variant used by `up-on-network`, targeting the exit server via LAN IP   |

On hosts running a default-deny host firewall (e.g. NixOS's
`networking.firewall`), the localcluster's P2P transport
(`DOCKER_NETWORK_GATEWAY:9000+i`) may be unreachable from the client container:
`gnosis_vpn-ctl status` (or the client logs) will show peers fetched
(`num_announced=3`) but never connected (`num_connected=0`), forever. If you hit
this, allow inbound UDP `9000..9000+CLUSTER_SIZE-1` from the testenv's Docker
bridge interface (`docker network inspect
$DOCKER_NETWORK` to find it) through
your host firewall.

## Notes

- The localcluster provisions one extra pre-funded HOPR identity
  (`--extra-identities 1`) that the gnosis_vpn-client uses to spin up its
  internal entry node — no manual funding required for local dev.
- The client config (`CONFIG_DIR/client.toml`) targets server-0 for both
  `[connection.bridge]` and `[connection.wg]`. Per-destination server selection
  is a planned client feature.
- `just gen-config` is idempotent against a running cluster and can be re-run to
  refresh configs without restarting anything.
- The localcluster's P2P host/announce address is `DOCKER_NETWORK_GATEWAY`, not
  `127.0.0.1` — `hoprd-localcluster --p2p-host` uses the same value for both the
  bind address and the on-chain announced multiaddr, so it must be a real,
  reachable IP (not `0.0.0.0`/`auto`). Since that gateway IP is a real interface
  on the host, native processes (e.g. `system-tests`) reach it exactly as they
  reached `127.0.0.1` before; containers on `DOCKER_NETWORK` reach it too.
- Exit-node (`gnosis_vpn-server`) containers are unaffected by this change and
  don't join `DOCKER_NETWORK` — the cluster already reaches their published host
  ports directly, as before.
