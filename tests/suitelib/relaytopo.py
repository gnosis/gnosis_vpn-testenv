"""Relay-scaling topologies for T33-relay-baseline and T34-single-relay-scaling.

A topology pins every client to one relay and one exit through the channel graph alone. The client config has
no fixed intermediates (v6 takes only a hop count), so at one hop the path is decided by the channels:

- the client holds exactly one outgoing channel, to its relay (the client's own strategy opens it: allowlist of
  that one relay, min = target = 1 channel), so the forward path is client -> relay -> exit;
- the exit holds exactly one outgoing channel, to the same relay (opened here through its REST API), so every
  return path the client can build is exit -> relay -> client;
- no other node has a channel. The final hop of a path needs none (RFC-0010 edges, RFC-0014 phase-2 fallback), so
  the relay forwards in both directions without one.

Two layouts on one localcluster started with `--channel-management none`:

- paired N (T33-relay-baseline): relays are nodes 0..N-1, exits N..2N-1; client k uses relay k-1 and exit N+k-1.
- shared N (T34-single-relay-scaling): node 0 is the only relay, exits are 1..N; client k uses exit k.

Client k also has its own VPN server (gnosis_vpn-server-{k-1}, bridge 8000+k-1, WireGuard 51821+k-1), so N exits
means N hoprd exit nodes with N servers behind them; one traffic target serves all. The layout is written to
CONFIG_DIR/relay-topology.json by tests/relay_topology.py and read back by the tests."""
