"""T01-topology-preconditions (gate): is the stack in the state every later test assumes? Reads the localcluster
status and every node's channel set, opens a 1-hop UDP session from the exit through each relay, waits for the
client worker, for DEST to be Ready and for the client's own outgoing channel, checks both liveness-ping targets
against the server's wggvpn addresses, checks that the traffic target is running and answers /health from the host
(it runs with --rm and no restart policy, so a dead one is a missing container; an external --no-cluster target the
host cannot reach is a WARN), and looks for leftover netem qdiscs and suite timers on the host. Every
running client container (up to sixteen, not only those the selection will touch) must have its tools sidecar: a
client without one is a mis-started stack; with --no-cluster it is a WARN. The effective client config is recorded
against the shipped defaults, not asserted. A FAIL aborts the run: a number
measured through a broken precondition looks like a finding.

Pass iff: cluster state is running; every node reports channels_open with at least CLUSTER_SIZE-1 outgoing channels
Open; with CLUSTER_SIZE >= 3 a 1-hop session from node 0 to every other node establishes within FWD_TIMEOUT s (a
later success fails naming the duration; the session is deleted either way); the client worker is online within
120 s; DEST is Ready within READY_TIMEOUT s; the client holds an outgoing channel within CLIENT_CHANNEL_TIMEOUT s;
both the configured [connection.ping] address and PERIODIC_PING_TARGET (the address a client <= 0.96.3 pings from
tunnel_ping_loop whatever the config says) are on the server's wggvpn; no netem qdisc on the host. WARN only:
another destination not Ready, an armed suite or deadman timer.

Why: a relay that pings at 6 ms can forward nothing (a production relay silently rejected tickets for 2.5 hours and
invalidated every run in the window), so the probe opens a session instead of pinging. A missing liveness-ping
target makes every session reconnect every ~85 s; two full runs were read as a load defect before that was found.
Not checked: channel balance, foreign peers on the exit, identity double-runs, announced addresses."""
