"""T11-capability-matrix (gate): does the tunnel behave as expected under each [connection.wg] capability set the
client can request? Cells: segmentation+no_delay (the default; exit shaper expected), segmentation alone (expected),
and the default plus no_rate_control (not expected). Each cell restarts the client with the set, connects, runs one
CALL_S call and polls the exit's /metrics POLL_N times at 2 s for per-session hopr_surb_balancer_* series, which
exist exactly while the exit shapes a session (the 'spawning exit SURB balancer' line is not logged at the default
level). Decapsulation errors come from the client log.

Pass iff, per cell, decap_error = 0 and the per-session balancer series count rose exactly when a shaper is expected.
Call loss and download rate are recorded.

Why: the exit's datagram mode on release/4.0 keys off the client's no_delay flag, so a client that drops it gets
frames cut at frame_size again; no_rate_control measured inert for throughput but removes the shaper, so a fresh
session then drops egress when SURBs run out instead of shaping. Config-only per cell and the only test that
catches a capability-dependency regression on either side."""
