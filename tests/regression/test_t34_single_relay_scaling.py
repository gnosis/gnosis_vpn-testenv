"""T34-single-relay-scaling (gate): how many concurrent clients can one relay carry? Rungs of LADDER="1 2 3 4 5":
n clients, each with its own exit, all through the same single relay in both directions (client k -> relay ->
exit k, and back over the relay), download DOWN_BYTES=100 MB at once, then upload UP_BYTES=100 MB at once. Its twin
is T35-single-exit-scaling (one exit): same ladder, same settings, same report. They do not read one-to-one: T34 puts all
traffic through one relay, while T35's exit spreads every client's return traffic over a pool of relays (see its
docstring). T33-relay-baseline runs the ladder with a relay and an exit per client.

Procedure (suitelib/relaybench.py): the channel graph is held against the topology before every rung (every client
and every exit exactly one Open channel, to the one relay); IDLE_S=10 after connecting (below the suite's
SURB_RAMP_WAIT floor on purpose, by request); every transfer of a phase starts at one common second (START_LEAD_S=5
after it is handed out); PAUSE_S=10 between download, upload and rungs. FAIL when a transfer does not complete within
CAP=300 s (100 MB in 300 s is 2.67 Mbit/s), when a complete transfer's bytes are not on its client's tunnel interface
counters, when the relay forwarded less than one packet per PKT_BYTES_MAX transferred bytes in either phase (the share
check of T33 is 100 % by construction here and only recorded), or (relay on its own machine) when the relay machine's
wire carried less than the transferred bytes in or out. The rates are recorded, not scored, over the overlap: the
window in which every client was transferring, from the last first byte to the first last byte; upload bytes count
when the target's TCP acknowledged them. Reported per rung: the relay's machine CPU (% of all its cores) and its hoprd
process's CPU (% of one core) over the overlap window, the aggregate per BUCKET_S=5 s (min / median / max), the
longest stall, the frames the clients discarded, the relay machine's UDP errors and wire bytes, the relay's own packet
counters, the other roles' machines, the hoprd and client versions and one line of machine specs per role.

Setup: `just relay-topology shared N` on one machine, or `just multihost-up HOSTS shared N` across machines, then
`just test t34` / `just multihost-test t34`. SKIP on any other stack."""
