"""T12-balancer-sweep (gate): how do the client's SURB balancer profiles move connect time, cold-start behaviour and
steady-state throughput, and where does the sweep collapse? Cells over [connection.surb_balancing.main]
max_surb_upstream in UPSTREAMS plus one cell with the raised ping tier (10 MB / 16 Mb/s); each cell restarts the
client with the config, connects (recording the time), runs one cold and one warm download of BYTES, and reads the
exit's session target. PASSES passes, even ones in reverse order. Then the masking cell: a cold download on the
default ping tier against one on the raised tier.

Pass iff the best warm download > 0 and the worst warm download across cells >= 0.3 x the best; and the masking
cell's cold download on the default ping tier completes within CAP (n = 1), whatever the raised tier did (both are
named, so a raised tier that passes shows the tuning masks a default-config defect). The masking cell is n = 1 and
the collapse is intermittent, so its PASS does not distinguish a fixed ramp from a lucky probe; check its
sensitivity before trusting it.

Why: 96 Mb/s collapsed downloads under a frame-discard storm while 48 was at baseline, and the raised ping tier was
exactly the tuned config that hid the 0.96.1 ramp bug for a day. The axis has a known cliff and a known mask."""
