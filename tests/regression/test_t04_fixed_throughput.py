"""T04-fixed-throughput (the core gate): one session; REPS cycles of [for each size in SIZES_MIB: download, then
upload] against the in-cluster target, each transfer capped at CAP s. Per transfer: bytes, elapsed, time to first
byte, Mbit/s, HTTP status, complete or truncated, and the longest zero-progress second from per-second sampling (a
5 s stall and a uniformly slow transfer have the same Mbit/s; the stall is what the user feels). After disconnect:
the four client-log error counters over the session and the client's undecodable counter before and after.

Three kinds of verdict line (one per size, one for the counters, two floors). Per size: PASS iff every transfer of that size completes in both directions (the line carries the
medians and the longest zero-progress second, so a size that stalls to the cap reads as a stall). Session
counters: PASS iff reassembly_failed = 0 and reconnects = 0. Floors: the download and upload medians at FLOOR_MIB
(the largest size in the cycle at or under it) must be at least DOWN_MIN_MBIT / UP_MIN_MBIT. Frame discards,
decapsulation errors and the other sizes' medians are recorded, not asserted. Calibration: the floors come from
ten warm 10 MB sessions on the reference stack, 10.9 down (stdev 0.45) and 13.0 up (stdev 0.69); the 2026-09
relay decode-concurrency regression halved throughput, so 7 catches a halving and clears host noise (+-12 %). No
size above 10 MiB has been calibrated as a rate, which is why the floors are not judged there.

Open finding, 2026-09-23 (run r3t04; hoprd 4.1.3 from the hoprd-4arb tree with its inert env-toggle patch,
client 0.96.3-a974f5fc glibc image, server 0.7.0; reproduced on 2026-09-24 in r3b3 and, on the upstream
Alpine/Nix images of the same commits, in up2): two of three 50 MiB downloads ran at 10-19 Mbit/s for
17-23 s (25-30 MB), hit a burst of frame discards (355 and 163 in ten seconds), then delivered nothing until the
90 s cap; five tunnel-ping timeouts and one reconnect followed, and the third completed on the fresh session.
1 and 10 MiB and every 50 MiB upload bar the one on the dead session completed; the exit and relays logged
nothing beyond routine SURB evictions. That is the download-side collapse of exploration/deep-2026-09-22,
reproduced by a plain TCP download that runs longer than a 10 MB one. Until it is fixed the full-length run is
red on the 50 MiB completion and the session counters; --fast (SIZES_MIB "1 10") passes. Once the issue exists,
STALL_ISSUE="gnosis_vpn-client#NNN" turns the completion above FLOOR_MIB and the counters into an XFAIL on the
mechanism (frame discards, zero progress for STALL_MIN_S s or more, a tunnel-ping timeout or reconnect) and into
an XPASS the day the size completes; an incomplete size without that mechanism is still a plain FAIL. STALL_ISSUE
is empty until the issue is opened, so the default run stays red rather than silenced.

Why: this harness produced every cell of the investigation, and its three outputs do not substitute for each
other: completions caught truncation, Mbit/s caught the 2x relay regression, the error counters caught the client
regression (uploads at 10 Mbit/s while downloads died at 0.37; a mean would have read 5 and hidden both). curl runs
inside the client container, where the tunnel routes are; the target is in-cluster so no internet path or CDN
rate limit enters the number."""
