"""T06-realtime-udp (gate): can the tunnel carry a fixed-rate flow, as opposed to a bulk TCP transfer that hides
return-path loss behind retransmission? Five arms, each on its own session (PER_ARM_SESSION): an idle control that
sends nothing for ECHO_DUR s (IDLE_ARM); a bidirectional echo call (relprobe against the target's :8901) at
ECHO_RATE for ECHO_DUR s, long enough to show a reconnect cycle; an upload-only and a download-only paced stream
(streamprobe against :8902) at STREAM_RATE for STREAM_DUR s, which tell the directions apart; and the download
stream again on a session that has just carried REPS bulk transfers (AFTER_BULK). Each probe reports loss, delay
above its minimum, stalls, rebinds and outage time; the probes re-bind when the tunnel interface is recreated and
keep their port, so loss means loss on the live path, and the outage a reconnect caused is reported beside it,
not inside it.

Idle arm: FAIL on any reconnect, WARN on a tunnel-ping timeout without one. Loaded arms, checked in this order:
FAIL RECONNECT on any reconnect (the verdict names the count, the tunnel-ping timeouts before it, rebinds and
outage seconds; three timeouts per reconnect means the liveness ping itself is failing); FAIL UNMEASURED when the
probe sent under SAMPLE_MIN_PCT of the expected RATE*1e6/8/SIZE*duration packets (a probe on a dead session sends
a handful and still prints a confident percentage: 255 of 4688, "60.78 % loss"); FAIL on no loss figure; FAIL at
loss >= LOSS_MAX or a gap over STALL_MAX s (counted over the probe's ten longest gaps, so the count is capped at
ten; any one over the limit fails the arm); PASS otherwise.

Why: the fleet recorded 54-96 % loss at 1.5 Mbit/s on a path whose TCP throughput looked fine. Each arm has its own
session because arms that shared one were order-dependent (82.7 % then 0.41 %). The after-bulk arm isolates what
T09 stumbled on: a 3 Mbit/s stream straight after bulk transfers on hoprd 4.1.3 showed 9-54 reassembly failures.
Until 2026-09-19 there were six rate arms and every one reconnected at ~50 s whatever the rate: that was the
liveness ping aimed at an address the server did not hold (T01 checks it now), not load. No XFAIL here: the one
that was tried came from a number contaminated by the SURB ramp."""
