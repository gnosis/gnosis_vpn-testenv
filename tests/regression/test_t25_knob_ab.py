"""T25-knob-ab (runbook): does one environment knob on one component explain a regression? Restart the cluster
with one env var changed (KNOB="K=V", default the relay decode concurrency at nproc x 8), everything else
untouched, and run REPS (--fast 2) T04-style transfers both ways; CLIENT_KNOB applies K=V to the client instead
(e.g. GNOSISVPN_SURB_RAMP_SECS=0). Nothing is asserted; both cells' medians are recorded. Every cluster node gets
the same env (per-role env is open extension 1).

Why: this is how both regressions were finally pinned (HOPR_INTERNAL_IN_PACKET_PIPELINE_CONCURRENCY was the hoprd
fix) and how a plausible suspect, the exit's LIFO SURB pop order, was cleared in one run. A negative result here is
as valuable as a positive one."""
