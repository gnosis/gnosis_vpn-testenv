"""T05-loaded-latency (gate): in-tunnel RTT idle, then during a saturating download, then during a saturating
upload, PHASE_S each (p50 and p95 per phase); then N in PARALLEL concurrent downloads of BYTES on the same session,
aggregate Mbit/s per N from the bytes curl actually received over the rung's wall time. Uploads are not run in
parallel: the scaling question is about the SURB-metered return path that downloads ride; T24 covers the forward
path alone. Runs fifth, right after the throughput reference, because loaded RTT taken after an hour of other
tests measures accumulated host load.

Pass iff loaded p95 <= DOWN_P95_MAX_MS in the download phase and <= UP_P95_MAX_MS in the upload phase; every
parallel flow completes within CAP (a rung with an incomplete flow fails naming the count and bytes); and no rung's
aggregate falls below 0.8 x the previous rung's. Until 2026-09-20 the aggregate was N x BYTES over wall time, so
a capped flow still counted as delivered and three runs read exactly the cap (5.33 Mbit/s at N=6).
Calibration: three full runs measured download p95 359, 537, 1076 ms and upload p95 1124, 1153, 1746 ms; the
fleet's bufferbloat finding was 2-4 s.

Why: on the fleet N = 1/3/6 downloads gave 5.7, 5.6, 3.3 Mbit/s while loaded RTT went 216, 511, 722 ms and a
parallel upload hit 8.9 s: the HOPR session path is the cap and its queues bloat. No other test measures latency
under load."""
