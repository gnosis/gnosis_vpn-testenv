"""T13-mtu-sweep (gate): does the size of the datagram the client emits change what the session does? Per MTU in
MTUS: force it on the tunnel interface right after connect (asserted from the interface, not the config), run
REPS (--fast 2) T04-style transfers and a 3 Mbit/s upload stream of STREAM_S.

Pass iff reconnects = 0 at every MTU (the FAIL names the MTUs that reconnected and says when the shape is the old
mechanism: 1420 and 1280 reconnect, 940 clean) and the download median at MTU 940 is at least
MTU940_DOWN_MIN_MBIT (12.3 on the reference stack; 6 sits under T04's 7 because a 940 B MTU carries about a third
more packets per byte). Until 2026-09-20 this was an XFAIL tagged hoprnet#8392; on hoprd 4.1.3 every MTU passed
and T24 ran 900 s at 1420 with 0 % loss, so the gate is plain and FIXED_BY names the mechanism for the day it
returns.

Why: MTU is a mechanism switch, not a tuning knob. At <= 940 B a datagram fits one HOPR packet, so no
opportunistic second SURB is minted, and that alone turned the sustained-upload death at +371 s into a clean
10-minute run while throughput did not change either way (9.15 vs 9.75 Mbit/s). A sweep reporting only Mbit/s would
have called it a null result."""
