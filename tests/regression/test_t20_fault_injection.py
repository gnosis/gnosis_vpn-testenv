"""T20-fault-injection (diagnostic): what happens to a live session when a relay degrades or disappears? During a
call: a tc netem loss ladder over LOSSES (%) on the host toward relay RELAY's P2P port, STEP_S per step, then a
full pause of the relay process (SIGSTOP for STEP_S), then restore. The call lasts (1 + len(LOSSES) + 3) x STEP_S
(until 2026-09-20 it was computed from the length of the LOSSES string and outran the script). SKIP unless root,
SKIP when the cluster status carries no pid for RELAY (a SIGSTOP of pid 0 stops the runner's own process group),
and SKIP naming the step when a tc qdisc or filter cannot be installed (an unimpaired tunnel would survive and
pass).

Each rung's 'tc qdisc change' is checked and recorded (applied per row); WARN when the session survived but a rung
was not applied. Otherwise PASS iff the client is still connected after the ladder and the pause; a miss is WARN.
Call loss, stalls and reconnects are recorded.

Why: T09 varies latency and membership between sessions; nothing else touches a fault arriving mid-session, the
real-world case. Upstream documents it as hazardous both ways: killing a return relay can collapse even a 0-hop
forward direction, and the automatic recovery is destructive on a false positive."""
