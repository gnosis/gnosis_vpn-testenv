"""T21-passive-observer (diagnostic): when the client says the network is broken, is it the network or the client?
The second client never connects; it polls destination health every 15 s for DUR s alongside client 1's view.
SKIP unless CLIENT2 runs. PASS iff the two disagree on the count of Ready destinations in at most 1/5 of the
samples.

Why: the active node reported most exits as merely Routable with 'Connection reset by peer' while an independent
passive node saw the same exits ReadyToConnect throughout; the fault was local, and 'the exits degrade' had
already been written down."""
