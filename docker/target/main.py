"""Run the four target services in one process; exit when any of them stops, so a dead service is a missing
container (no restart policy) that T01-topology-preconditions catches, never a target that answers some ports.
The services are plain modules (callecho, streamsrv, callsrv, speedtarget) that the suite's self-tests also start
on loopback without a container; the container exists only to place them on the far side of the exit."""
