# Regression test catalogue

The suite in `tests/` runs 24 tests, plus the relay-scaling gates T33 to T35
that need a topology of their own, against a `gnosis_vpn-testenv` stack
(localcluster, exit server, client containers, in-cluster traffic target) and
keeps 8 runbook entries for investigations. Each test's method, criteria and the
incident it comes from are in its module docstring
(`tests/regression/test_tNN_<name>.py`); this file is the index: kind, group,
knobs, what passes. Rules for changing the suite are in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), mechanics in [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md).

## Running it

```sh
just suite                    # the one run: T01 … T24 in file order
just suite --fast             # shorter durations; every sustained arm stays ≥ 90 s
just suite --very-fast        # 15 s arms, 1-2 MiB transfers: smoke only, cannot see a reconnect cycle
just suite --only t04,t06     # T01 still runs first unless skipped explicitly
just suite --group realtime   # one group (preflight, throughput, realtime, resilience, config, attribution, multiclient, endurance, relayscale)
just suite --knob T23_DUR=150 # a per-test knob beats --very-fast; also as env T23_DUR=150
just test t10                 # one test, including runbook entries
just relay-topology paired 5 && just test t33   # T33 on its own topology (T34: shared, T35: single-exit)
just suite --client NAME --dest ID --target HOST --no-cluster   # a production exit; cluster-only checks skip
just suite-selftest           # offline: library, target services, probe contracts
```

Results go to `SUITE_OUT_DIR/<run-id>/`: `rows.jsonl` (every measurement),
`verdicts.jsonl`, `summary.csv`, `provenance.json`, `console.log`, `junit.xml`,
`logs/`, `samples/`. A run id that already holds results is refused.

## Kinds

| Kind         | Meaning                                   | Scoring                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **gate**     | must pass on a healthy stack              | PASS / FAIL; only a gate can fail a run |
| _diagnostic_ | characterization, control or covariate    | recorded; a FAIL becomes WARN           |
| _runbook_    | investigation or fleet tooling, in no run | `just test tNN`                         |

A group (`--group NAME`, the third field of each heading below) is a named
selection for one measurement at a time; it never changes the order. Order is
load-bearing: T03-repeatability-baseline runs third (the stack's repeatability
is on record before any gate reads a number), T05-loaded-latency fifth and
T06-realtime-udp sixth (loaded latency and real-time loss are only comparable
before an hour of load). A T01-topology-preconditions FAIL aborts the run.

**Common parameters** (`suitelib/config.py`; `--fast` values in parentheses):
`BYTES`=10000000 (5000000; `--very-fast` 2000000), `CAP`=90 s (60; 30), `REPS`=3
(2; 1), `SURB_RAMP_WAIT`=25 s (the floor on every post-connect idle unless a
test passes `ramp_wait_opt_out=True`; it must not be raised, a longer idle lets
the return-path SURBs expire), `CONNECT_TIMEOUT`=240 s, `TEST_TIMEOUT`=7200 s (a
module may compute its own `TIMEOUT(knobs)`), `DEADMAN`=900 s (a session that
must last longer calls `client.deadman_cover(SECONDS)`), `DEST`=node-0,
`CLUSTER_SIZE`=3. Every pass criterion below is what the script enforces;
anything the design asked for but the code does not assert is "recorded".

## Thresholds

Every number a gate holds a measurement against is absolute and named; every
p50/p95/p99 is the nearest-rank quantile (the ⌈p·n⌉-th smallest sample, one line
shared verbatim by the suite, the probes and the target); nothing is compared
with a previous run (delta scoring ratcheted, mixed run modes and once passed a
delivery collapse inside a ±279 % band). Calibrated on the reference stack
(hoprd 4.1.3 `release/4.1`, client 0.96.3, server 0.7.0, one 8-vCPU host,
2026-09-20, glibc builds) at full-length durations; the upstream images of the
same commits read 11.8 / 13.0 at 10 MiB on 2026-09-24; a `--very-fast` run reads
20-40 % lower and its threshold verdicts are smoke-level. A run
T03-repeatability-baseline flags UNSTABLE makes every threshold verdict weak
evidence. An XFAIL is tagged with the issue it waits on (T04-fixed-throughput's
`STALL_ISSUE`) and reports XPASS when the defect is gone; an XPASS on a gate
fails the run until the tag is removed, so a fix never goes green silently; the
stall is intermittent, so re-run once before removing the tag.

### T02-build-provenance · **gate** · preflight

Versions, image digests, OCI revision labels and the compiled-in
`/hopr/mix/<ver>` id of client worker and hoprd; writes `provenance.json`. PASS
iff both ids are readable and equal; FAIL if they differ; WARN if one is
unreadable. The exit server carries no id.

### T03-repeatability-baseline · _diagnostic_ · preflight

`N`=10 (5; 3) unchanged warm cells of one download and one upload of `BYTES`.
Recorded: medians, stdev, `mde_pct` = 2·1.96·stdev/mean/√`REPS`·100 (larger of
the two directions); `UNSTABLE BASELINE` above `UNSTABLE_PCT`=50.

### T04-fixed-throughput · **gate** · throughput

One session; `REPS` cycles of download-then-upload at each of `SIZES_MIB`="1 10
50" MiB ("1 10"; `--very-fast` "1 2"), `CAP` each, per-second stall detection,
client-log counters, undecodable telemetry delta. `WAIT_AFTER_CONNECT`=0
(floored to `SURB_RAMP_WAIT`). Three kinds of verdict line (one per size, one
for the counters, two floors): per size PASS iff every transfer of that size
completes both ways (the line names the medians and the longest zero-progress
second); session counters PASS iff `reassembly_failed`=0 and `reconnects`=0;
floors: the medians at `FLOOR_MIB`=10 ≥ `DOWN_MIN_MBIT`=7 / `UP_MIN_MBIT`=7.
Discards, decap errors and the other sizes' medians recorded. Open finding on
the reference stack (run r3t04, 2026-09-23): the 50 MiB download stalls after
25-30 MB (frame-discard burst, zero progress to the cap, tunnel-ping reconnect),
so the full-length run fails the 50 MiB completion and the counters; `--fast`
passes. Details in the module docstring.

### T05-loaded-latency · **gate** · throughput

In-tunnel RTT idle, under a saturating download and a saturating upload,
`PHASE_S`=30 s (15; 8) each; then `PARALLEL`="1 3 6" ("1 3" very-fast)
concurrent downloads of `BYTES`. PASS iff p95 ≤ `DOWN_P95_MAX_MS`=1500 and ≤
`UP_P95_MAX_MS`=2500, every parallel flow completes within `CAP` (a rung with an
incomplete flow fails naming the count, the bytes and the session counters:
reconnects, tunnel-ping timeouts, discards, reassembly failures), and no rung's
aggregate (bytes received over wall time) falls below 0.8 × the previous rung's.
The session's log slice is saved as `t05.log`.

### T06-realtime-udp · **gate** · realtime

Five arms, each on its own session: idle control for `ECHO_DUR`; echo call at
`ECHO_RATE`=1.5 Mbit/s for `ECHO_DUR`=300 s (120; 15); upload-only and
download-only streams at `STREAM_RATE`=3 Mbit/s for `STREAM_DUR`=120 s (90; 15);
the download stream after `REPS` bulk transfers. `SIZE`=1200 B. Idle arm: FAIL
on a reconnect, WARN on a ping timeout. Loaded arms, in order: FAIL RECONNECT on
any reconnect; FAIL UNMEASURED under `SAMPLE_MIN_PCT`=80 % of expected packets;
FAIL on no loss figure; FAIL at loss ≥ `LOSS_MAX`=5 % or a gap > `STALL_MAX`=5
s; PASS otherwise. Rebinds and outage seconds reported next to loss.

### T07-cold-start · **gate** · throughput

`REPS` (1) transfers straight after connect (ramp wait opted out) vs after
`WARM`=25 s. PASS iff `reconnects`=0 in both arms, cold completions ≥ warm
completions, cold decap errors ≤ max(`COLD_DECAP_FLOOR`=5, `COLD_DECAP_MULT`=2 ×

reference) and the exit's SURB target recorded.

### T08-relay-attribution · **gate** · attribution

One download of `BYTES` at `hopr_transport::path=debug`; return paths counted
per first-hop relay from the `path=[…]` field. Membership: PASS iff every first
hop is an `Open` outgoing channel peer of the exit or the exit. Split, gated
only with `SUITE_EQUAL_LATENCY`=1, ≥ 2 relays and ≥ `SPLIT_MIN_PATHS`=1000

otherwise. WARN with no resolved-path lines.

### T09-impairment-ladder · **gate** · resilience

`tc netem` on the host toward the relays' P2P ports, fresh session per cell:
`equal-<ms>` for each of `RUNGS`="0 25 50" ("0 25"), `gap-<ms>` (relay 1 only),
`far-100ms` (`FAR`=100, relay 2 only). Per cell a 3 Mbit/s download stream of
`STREAM_S`=120 s (90; 8) first, then 3 (2) transfer reps. PASS iff every equal
cell has `reassembly_failed`=0 and `reconnects`=0. Gap and far cells, stream
loss and completions recorded. A cell whose `tc` steps fail is FAIL (equal) or
RECORDED (gap, far) and is not measured. SKIP without root or below
`CLUSTER_SIZE`=3.

### T10-forced-reconnect · **gate** · resilience

A `DUR`=300 s (150; 130) call; at `T_KILL`=60 s (20) the client's own WireGuard
peer is removed on the exit (found by allowed-ips). Arms T (far end keeps
streaming) and S (far end pauses while the client is silent), `REPEATS`=3 (1)
each. PASS iff the first downstream packet after the removal arrives within
`RECOVER_MAX`=90 s and `DecapStalled`=0 in every repeat; a repeat whose key
cannot be read or whose removal fails FAILs.

### T11-capability-matrix · **gate** · config

Cells over `[connection.wg] capabilities`: `segmentation+no_delay` (shaper
expected), `segmentation` (expected), `+no_rate_control` (not expected); per
cell a client restart, one `CALL_S`=60 s (30; 8) call and `POLL_N`=10 (4) polls
of the exit's per-session `hopr_surb_balancer_*` series. PASS iff
`decap_error`=0 and the series count rose exactly when a shaper is expected.

### T12-balancer-sweep · **gate** · config

Cells `main:<U>` for `UPSTREAMS`="12 16 48 96" Mb/s ("16 96"; "16") plus
`ping:10MB`; per cell a client restart, connect time, one cold and one warm
download; `PASSES`=2 (1), even passes reversed. PASS iff the worst warm download
≥ 0.3 × the best (best > 0) and the masking cell's cold download on the default
ping tier completes within `CAP` (n = 1, whatever the raised tier did). The
masking cell's sensitivity is unproven; do not read its PASS as proof the ramp
is fixed.

### T13-mtu-sweep · **gate** · resilience

Per `MTUS`="1420 1280 940" ("1420 940" very-fast), forced on the interface after
connect: `REPS` (2) transfers and a 3 Mbit/s upload stream of `STREAM_S`=120 s
(10 very-fast). PASS iff `reconnects`=0 at every MTU and the MTU 940 download
median ≥ `MTU940_DOWN_MIN_MBIT`=6. Formerly an XFAIL tagged
`FIXED_BY`=hoprnet#8392; plain since 2026-09-20.

### T14-novpn-baseline · _diagnostic_ · throughput

`REPS` transfers of `BYTES` straight to the target, tunnel down, plus direct

### T15-warmup-knee · _diagnostic_ · throughput

One download per idle in `DELAYS`="0 5 15 30 60" s ("0 5 20"; "0 5") after a
fresh connect. Recorded: the knee (first delay reaching `KNEE_FRAC`=0.8 × the
best rate), flagged beyond `KNEE_MAX_S`=30.

### T16-metric-sampling · _diagnostic_ · attribution

1 Hz node, container and client-balancer samples through one 2×`BYTES` download

correlation and slope, health-check session count.

### T17-latency-matrix · _diagnostic_ · attribution

`N`=10 hoprd pings per ordered node pair plus a peer survey; `STDEV_MAX`=25
declared, not asserted. With `SUITE_LATENCY_MAP`="idx=ms …" it gates: node0→idx
median within `LATENCY_TOL_MS`=15 of ms + the node0→node1 median, or ≥ ms.

### T18-capacity-ceiling · _diagnostic_ · realtime

Download streams of `STEP_S`=60 s (30; 12) per rung of `LADDER`="1 2 4 8 12 16"
Mbit/s ("2 4 8 12"; "4 8"). Recorded: the knee (last rung with loss < 5 %), CPU
per node, watchdog reconnects per rung.

### T19-background-load · _diagnostic_ · multiclient

Client 1 downloads `BYTES` with client 2 idle, then with client 2 fetching
`TRICKLES`="10 100" kB ("100" very-fast) every 2 s. WARN when the control is
incomplete or a trickle arm is incomplete or below `STEP_FRAC`=0.5 × idle;

### T20-fault-injection · _diagnostic_ · resilience

During a call: `tc netem` loss over `LOSSES`="1 5 20" % ("5" very-fast) toward
relay `RELAY`=1, `STEP_S`=60 s (30; 12) per step, then SIGSTOP for `STEP_S`,
then restore, 2 × `STEP_S` of settle and a `WATCHDOG_S`=90 s window (three
liveness-ping cycles, the watchdog's decision time). WARN when a rung was not
applied; otherwise PASS iff the client is still connected with no watchdog
reconnect at the end of the window; a reconnect inside it or a lost session is
WARN, naming the reconnects and the tunnel-ping timeouts. Counters and status
are read after the window, never before (full-rebased-1's T20 read them 17 s
before the watchdog fired). SKIP without root, without a relay pid, or when a
qdisc cannot be installed.

### T21-passive-observer · _diagnostic_ · multiclient

Client 2 never connects and polls destination health every 15 s for `DUR`=300 s

Rungs of `LADDER`="1 2 4" clients downloading `BYTES` at once, each warmed with
`WARMUP_BYTES`=500000 first (`WARMUP`=1), `CAP` (45 very-fast). Per rung FAIL if
any client fails to connect or complete, with the per-client diagnosis. Across
the ladder PASS iff no higher rung's aggregate falls more than `TOL_PCT`=25 %
below any lower rung's and the top rung's aggregate ≥ `AGG_MIN_MBIT`=8. Fairness
recorded. SKIP below 2 clients.

### T23-sustained-soak · **gate** · endurance

A `CALL_RATE`=1.5 Mbit/s call for `DUR`=3600 s (600; 60) plus a transfer pair
every `INTERVAL`=300 s (30 very-fast); RSS and log growth sampled. FAIL
UNMEASURED under `SAMPLE_MIN_PCT`=80 % of expected call packets; otherwise PASS
iff `reconnects`=0, final RSS < 2 × initial + 200000 kB, log growth <
`LOG_MB_MIN_MAX`=200 MB/min, call loss < `CALL_LOSS_MAX`=5 % (a missing report
is 100 %). Deadman covered.

### T24-sustained-upload · **gate** · endurance

Upload-only stream at `RATE`=3 Mbit/s for `DUR`=900 s (240; 25) at each of
`MTUS`="default 940". PASS iff per MTU loss < 5 %, `reconnects`=0 and the
client's undecodable counter grew by < 50; a missing server report is an
UNMEASURED FAIL. Deadman covered.

## Relay scaling

Two gates that measure relays, not the client: each runs on a topology
`just relay-topology MODE N` builds (it takes the stack down first) and SKIPs on
any other stack, so in the one run they cost nothing. `tests/relay_topology.py`
starts a localcluster with `--channel-management none`, one pre-funded identity
and one config file per client, one VPN server per exit node, and pins every path through the
channel graph: each client's strategy opens exactly one channel, to its relay
(`[strategy]` `min_open_channels`=`target_open_channels`=1 and a one-peer
`channel_allowlist`), and each exit gets exactly one channel, to the same relay,
through its REST API. At one hop that fixes both directions, client → relay →
exit and the return path exit → relay → client, since the final hop of a path
needs no channel. `just relay-topology-check` holds the live graph against the
saved layout. The stock `hoprd-localcluster` caps a cluster at five nodes (its
five frozen identities); T33-relay-baseline at five clients needs ten, so build
the localcluster with `patches/hoprd-localcluster-max16.patch` (random
identities, which the cluster uses, deploy their Safes on chain at start and are
not bound to the frozen set; up to 16 nodes). The hoprd binary under test is
unchanged.

The ladder (`suitelib/relaybench.py`), per rung of `LADDER`="1 2 3 4 5" clients:
hold the chain's channel graph against the topology (anything else FAILs the
rung before it runs), connect the rung's clients at once, wait `IDLE_S`=10 s
(below `SURB_RAMP_WAIT` on purpose, by request), download on every client at
once, wait `PAUSE_S`=10 s, upload on every client at once, disconnect, wait
`PAUSE_S` before the next rung. Each transfer runs in
`tests/probes/transferprobe.py` in the client's tools sidecar and logs its
cumulative bytes with epoch timestamps; all transfers of a phase start at one
common epoch second (`START_LEAD_S`=5 s after they are handed out, so reaching
remote clients does not stagger them) and the spread of the actual starts is
reported as start skew.

**The rates are those of the overlap**: the window from the last transfer's
first byte to the first transfer's last byte, in which every client was moving
data. Aggregate = the bytes all clients moved inside it / its length; per client
= each client's bytes inside it / its length (mean and minimum). With one client
it is the whole transfer. (Earlier runs reported a "wall-clock aggregate", all
bytes / time to the last finish, which counts the tail after the first clients
finished; the overlap does not.)

Upload bytes count when the target's TCP acknowledged them (the probe subtracts
the socket's send queue, `SIOCOUTQ`), not when they were handed to the socket:
the first version counted the latter and its upload rates ran ahead of the wire
by the send buffer. A mean hides a path that collapses and recovers, so each
phase also reports the aggregate per `BUCKET_S`=5 s inside the overlap (min /
median / max) and the longest stretch without progress of any transfer.

A rung PASSes iff every transfer completes within `CAP`, and the evidence of
its path holds: every complete transfer's bytes are on its client's tunnel
interface counters (the probe binds to the interface and reads its rx/tx
around the transfer); the relays forwarded at least one packet per
`PKT_BYTES_MAX`=1000 transferred bytes during the download and during the upload
(`RELAY_METRIC`=`hopr_packets_count{type="forwarded"}`; a HOPR packet carries
less, so a transfer that bypassed the relays fails); where each return path is
pinned to its client's relay and there is more than one relay (T33), at least
`ATTRIB_MIN_PCT`=90 % of all forwarded packets went through the rung's own
relays; and, where the node under test has machines of its own (multi-machine),
their wire interfaces carried at least the transferred bytes in the direction
of the transfer. Rates are recorded, not scored, until calibrated. Each run
records the hoprd version (REST `/node/version` of a relay and of an exit), the
client version and image, one line of machine specs per role and how far any
machine's clock can be from the runner's (the probes start on their own clocks,
so "start skew 0" only says no probe started late), and leads its report with
the node under test: its machine's CPU (% of all cores) and its hoprd process's
CPU (% of one core), sampled every `SAMPLE_S`=2 s on the machine and cut to the
same overlap window as the rates; its machine's UDP error counters (a socket
buffer that overflows drops packets while the CPU looks idle); its hoprd's own
packet counters; the frames the clients discarded. The other roles' machines
are recorded too. Each run writes `<TEST>.md`, one line per rung.

### T33-relay-baseline · **gate** · relayscale

`just relay-topology paired 5`: client k → relay k → exit k, as many relays and
exits as clients (`CLUSTER_SIZE`=10). The baseline: on one host every relay
shares the machine, so this ladder shows what the host allows.

### T34-single-relay-scaling · **gate** · relayscale

`just relay-topology shared 5` (or `just multihost-up HOSTS shared N`): every
client through one relay to its own exit. `DOWN_BYTES`=`UP_BYTES`=100000000,
`CAP`=300 s (2.67 Mbit/s). Under test: the relay. The twin of
T35-single-exit-scaling: same ladder, settings and report (they do not read
one-to-one, see T35).

### T35-single-exit-scaling · **gate** · relayscale

`just multihost-up HOSTS single-exit N` (or
`just relay-topology single-exit N`): one exit for every client; client k holds
one channel, to relay k, and the exit one channel to each relay. So each
client's forward path (its upload) is pinned to its own relay, but its return
paths (its download) run over all the relays the exit has a channel to: in the
2026-09-30 run each of ten relays carried 9-10 % of it at every rung, also with
one client. T35 therefore measures one exit behind a pool of relays, not a relay
per client, and does not read one-to-one against T34-single-relay-scaling;
pinning the return path would need a fresh stack per rung.
`DOWN_BYTES`=`UP_BYTES`=100000000, `CAP`=300 s. Under test: the exit, which is
one hoprd exit node and its one VPN server, as in the field (its machine also
runs the traffic target; the first version ran a VPN server per client there).
Each client tops out by itself, so the aggregate is what the exit carried, not
what it can carry. Signs of the exit's limit: the per-client rate falls, the
buckets spread, the exit machine's UDP errors start to move during the uploads
(on downloads they move at every rung, also with one client), the exit process
stops gaining CPU. Machine CPU alone does not tell (a hoprd node levels off
near 60 % of its machine), and the relay machines must be read first: at that
same level the top rungs do not tell the exit from the relay pool.
T22-concurrent-clients keeps its standard stack.

## Multi-machine testenv

`tests/multihost.py` spreads one stack over several machines: the chain (Anvil +
Blokli), the relays, the exits (with the VPN servers and the traffic target) and
the clients (their containers and the suite) each on a machine of its own, or
any of them sharing one. A hosts file names each role's machine (`ssh`), the
address the others reach it at (`addr`, preferably a private network: the chain,
the nodes' REST and P2P ports bind to it and nothing else) and its binaries;
`multihost/hosts.example.toml` is the template. Run it on the clients' machine,
which needs ssh to the others (a dedicated key).

```sh
just multihost-check HOSTS                 # every machine: reachable, binaries with checksums, images, repo
just multihost-up HOSTS paired 5           # T33-relay-baseline's topology; `shared 5` for T34, `standard 5` for T22
just multihost-test t33                    # the test against it (CONFIG_DIR/multihost.env)
just multihost-down HOSTS
```

How it comes up: the chain container starts on its machine; the relays' and the
exits' machines each run a `hoprd-localcluster` with `--chain-url` at that
chain, `--p2p-host`/`--api-host` their `addr` and `--channel-management none`,
one after the other because both fund from the chain's one dev account. Each
localcluster pre-announces its nodes right after their Safes (the window Blokli
re-indexes), so every node reaches every other. The relays' cluster also mints
the clients' identities. The merged status (relays node-0.., exits after them,
each with its REST URL, `ssh` target and role) is written to
`CONFIG_DIR/multihost.json` and read by the suite through `MULTIHOST_STATUS`;
the target is reached through `TARGET_HOST`. `paired` and `shared` build the
relay-scaling topology as `just relay-topology` does; `standard` is
T22-concurrent-clients' stack, two relays and one exit in a full mesh with the
clients on their own strategy. T33 and T34 then report CPU per machine (sampled
on that machine over ssh) instead of one host figure.

**One machine per node and per client (DigitalOcean).** `multihost/do_fleet.py`
runs where the API token is (`DO_API_KEY_FILE`, default `~/DO_API_KEY`; it is
only ever sent to api.digitalocean.com and `.gitignore` keeps `DO_API_KEY*` out
of the repository). `create --name N --clients 5 --relays 5 --exits 5` makes a
control droplet (the chain and the suite) plus one droplet per client, relay and
exit; `wait` returns once every droplet has run its first-boot setup (docker,
just, WireGuard tools, pytest); `hosts` prints the hosts file for the control
droplet; `destroy` deletes every droplet of the fleet and checks none is left.
Then, on the control droplet: `just multihost-provision HOSTS` (binaries, images
and the repo from the control droplet to every other),
`just multihost-up HOSTS MODE 5`, `just multihost-test tNN`. Defaults:
`g-4vcpu-16gb` (dedicated General Purpose, regular Intel) in `lon1`, because
`fra1` offered no dedicated-CPU size on 2026-09-30. A token without account-key
scope works: the SSH key goes in through the first-boot script, which also
unexpires root's password (without an account key DigitalOcean sets an expiring
one, and sshd then refuses every non-interactive login). Fetch the run
directories before `destroy`. Every droplet goes into the DigitalOcean project
`--project` (default "Gnosis VPN test infra"; `assign` moves existing droplets).
`bake --snapshot NAME --source HOST` builds a snapshot with the tools, the five
images, the node binaries and the repo (image:create scope needed);
`create --image <snapshot id>` then gives droplets that are ready about 55 s
after creation and need no provisioning beyond a repo update. Rebake when a
version changes; `snapshots` lists them.

## Open extensions

1. **Per-role node versions and env in the localcluster.** Every node comes from
   one hoprd binary with one `CLUSTER_ENV`; T27-role-split cannot run and
   T25-knob-ab/T26-version-matrix cannot vary one role. The single most
   informative missing test.
2. **Client telemetry in the metrics stack.** The suite reads
   `gnosis_vpn-ctl -o json telemetry` with `docker exec` where it needs a client
   counter; scraping it at 1 Hz next to the node metrics would let
   T16-metric-sampling correlate it.
3. **A client build with inbound-read instrumentation** for T31-frame-forensics:
   a flag or patch that logs the length and leading bytes of every inbound
   datagram.

Provided by testenv already: the in-cluster target (`just target-start`,
`docker/target/`), several funded client containers (`CLIENT_COUNT`,
`EXTRA_IDENTITIES`), run metadata and JSONL output, size-capped container logs,
live `tc netem` impairment and `CLUSTER_LATENCY`, 0-hop destinations
(`HOPS0_ALSO`), a second passive client (`just client2-start`).
